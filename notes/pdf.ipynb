    "It's often the case that we can do a huge amount of cleanup on unstructured text before using Python to process it more formally. We can convert everything to, delete unwanted characters, squeeze repeated characters, reformat, etc... In this section you will do a number of exercises that get you use to processing files from the command line. If you'd like to dig further, you can see [this link](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/textproc.html).\n",

    "The operating system launches all commands in a pipeline sequence as separate processes, which means they can run on multiple processors. This gives us parallel processing without having to do any work. As data is completed by one stage, it passes it to the next stage of the pipeline, and continues to work on its input. The next stage consumes that input in parallel. Consequently, processing text from the command line can be extremely efficient, much more so than doing it in Python."
