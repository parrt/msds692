    "# Representing text in a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "As with everything else in the computer, we represent text using numbers.  The sound simple but gets involved very quickly with lots of details. As data scientists we have to be able to load data from data files into memory and extract data from the Internet/web. That means we have to understand how computers represent characters and how they are stored on disk; it's often not just a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at [7-bit ascii codes](http://www.asciitable.com/), you'll see how Americans encoded the English character set (upper and lower case, numbers, punctuation, and some other characters like newlines and tab). They represent the numbers < 127, which fits in 7 bits (2^7 is 128).  A string such as `abc` was represented by three bytes, one byte per character. It is a very dense encoding, meaning very few bits are wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a very long time, other languages were out of luck. A number of countries used the remaining 128..255 numeric values to encode characters useful to their language such as accented letters like ś and ŝ. They typically used the [Latin-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1) character set. The problem is that lots of countries used the number 201, but for different characters.  For example, Russian characters were often mapped to numbers using a [KOI8-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R) mapping that overlapped with the 0..255 used by ASCII, Latin-1. Enter Unicode. See [Unicode vs ascii in python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html) for more details than I have here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is an agreed-upon standard that maps visible characters for just about any human language to numeric values (called code points). Conveniently, the first 127 values map exactly to ASCII characters. Here is a [mapping of character to numeric value](http://unicode-table.com/en/). For example, here is how [Bengali characters are encoded](http://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/bengali/):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/bengali.png\" style=\"width:700px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading from this table left to right,  the first character is 980+0, the second is 980+1, etc...  The only trick is that the numbers on the left are in hexadecimal. You will see the notation U+0981. Hexadecimal, base 16, is used because all possible values within 16 bits fit in 4 hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent Unicode we have to use 16-bit (2 byte) not 8-bit (1 byte) characters. Rats. Oh well, we can buy more memory. According to the documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since Python 3.0, the language features a str type that contain Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "So, worst-case, Python string `\"abc\"` takes 3 x 2 bytes = 6 bytes. Python 3 does seem to do some optimization, keeping strings as 1-byte-per-char as long as possible, until we introduce a non-ASCII character. We can verify this char size with the `getsizeof` function:"

    "Storing a Python string with characters codes that fit into 8 bits (1 byte) into a file is straightforward. Every character in the string is written to the file as a byte. We get a sequence of 8-bit numbers in the file, each byte representing a single character. Compression algorithms can reduce that space requirement but, for an uncompressed format, it's very tight.\n",
