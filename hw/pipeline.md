# Data translation pipeline

## Goal

The goal of this lab is to study the most common text-based data formats: `csv`, `xml`, `json`, and `html`. Parsing data files can be tricky, but generating them is easy. In this first homework, you will therefore be generating data in multiple formats but using standard Python libraries to read that data back in. The exception is that you will be parsing comma-separated value (CSV) files the hard way. The basic idea is that you will be able to read in some data in csv format and pass it around a pipeline of data conversions, ultimately getting it back to the original format:

From the commandline, it will look like this:

```bash
$ cat data.csv | \
  python csv2xml.py | \
  python xml2csv.py | \
  python csv2json.py | \
  python json2csv.py > samedata.csv
$ diff data.csv samedata.csv | wc
       0       0       0
```

The last line just checks to make sure that there is no difference between the original file and the data after it's been pushed through the pipeline.

## Description

### Getting some initial stock data

Grab Apple's 35 year stock history using this URL

```
http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=AAPL
```

The file generated by that website is a CSV file with 8996 lines, which we can discover easily with `wc`:
 
```bash
$ wc ~/github/msan692/data/AAPL.csv
    8996    8997  583817 /Users/parrt/github/msan692/data/AAPL.csv
```

The first thing to notice is that there is a header row that describes the data in the various columns.
 
```bash
$ head ~/github/msan692/data/AAPL.csv
Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume,Adj Close
2016-08-12,107.779999,108.440002,107.779999,108.18,18612300,108.18
2016-08-11,108.519997,108.93,107.849998,107.93,27484500,107.93
2016-08-10,108.709999,108.900002,107.760002,108.00,24008500,108.00
```

The data follows the header row, with one record per line. The key element of the CSV format is the separator, more specifically the venerable comma. It is the column or field separator that allows us to distinguish between the elements. For *m* columns, there are *m-1* separators. For *n* records, there are *n* lines (with possibly a header row in addition).

### Parsing simple CSV files

```csv
when,a,b
2016-08-12,1.2,3
2016-08-13,3.99003,4.3
```

```python
import sys

def getdata():
    if len(sys.argv)==1: # if no file given, read from stdin
        data = sys.stdin.read()
    else:
        f = open(sys.argv[1], "r")
        data = f.read()
        f.close()
    return data.strip()

def readcsv(data):
    """
    Read CSV with header from data string and return a list of lists
    """
```

###  Generating HTML

```html
<html>
<body>
<table>
<tr><th>when</th><th>a</th><th>b</th></tr>
<tr><td>2016-08-12</td><td>1.2</td><td>3.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>2016-08-13</td><td>3.99003</td><td>4.3</td></tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
```

### Generating XML

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<file>
  <headers>when,a,b</headers>
  <data>
    <record>
      <when>2016-08-12</when><a>1.2</a><b>3.0</b>
    </record>
    <record>
      <when>2016-08-13</when><a>3.99003</a><b>4.3</b>
    </record>
  </data>
</file>
```

From within the chrome browser, the real XML data from the AAPL history looks like this (although I may have added an XML viewer plug into the browser):

### Generating JSON

```bash
$ python csv2json.py < testdata.csv > /tmp/t.json
```

```json
{
  "headers":["when", "a", "b"],
  "data":[
    {
      "when":"2016-08-12", "a":"1.2", "b":"3"
    },
    {
      "when":"2016-08-13", "a":"3.99003", "b":"4.3"
    },
    {
      "when":""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Reading JSON data

```bash
$ python json2csv.py < /tmp/t.json
```
